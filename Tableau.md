Summary:

After looking at how different factors(Gender, Ticket
Class, Age Group, Embarked from) affect survival rate of the
passenger we seen that certain population groups had a distinct
advantage over the others. Females, Elderly and those with the
highest ticket class were given the highest priority during
emergency. Men had a lowly survival rate of only 19% vs the 74%
of women meaning that they were significantly more willing to risk
their lives for others. Those with a higher ticket class were probably
given more help as their survival is 38% higher than the lowest
class.


Design: 

I designed this project to show my mom, who is a fashion designer
and deals with numbers regularly. She is not too fancy into graphs
so I wanted to make something she could easily understand as she
is always asking me about what exactly I am doing in this course.
So I stuck with regular statistic and simple diagrams that she would
easily be able to relate to. I looked at how factors(Gender, Ticket
Class, Age Group, Embarked from) affect survival rate of the
passenger.

I took the feedback very seriously and decided to make the plots
look as if they could be understood even without me there. First I
changed ‘0’ and ‘1’ to ‘female’ and ‘male’ respectively and i made
the plot thinner so that the bars take up majority of the view space.
For the second plot, I split the age into three categories of Under
25, 25-55 years, and Elderly(55+ yrs) to bin the data and make it
clear which age group survived more in general. I also made the
plot horizontal so that  the relative differences can be easily
compared with the dual segmentation. I decided to represent port
embarked as a pie chart as it adds variety to the representations
and only 3 categories makes it apt for such a chart. After the
feedback I put into the full names of the ports instead of the
abbreviations and I changed added proportion as a hover tool.
This shows a much more accurate portrayal of the
different port survival statistic. I also removed the two null data
points.


For the fourth graph, I changed count survived to proportion from
that class survived. This shows a much more accurate portrayal of
which classes were given preference during emergency. And I did
the same for the last plot denoting Sex. I also changed the heading
so that she can more easily understand what she is looking at in the
graphs.



Feedback:

My mom works in fashion and is not too fancy with
numbers so wanted to create something she would easily
understand. I sat down with her for a while and tried explaining her
everything and she had a few confusions. I noted down her issues 

For the first graph:
-What does ‘0’ and ‘1’ mean?
-Why are the bar lines so thin? 
For second graph:
-So many bars makes it confusing to get the point of the graph
-Why not club age groups in categories?
-Long vertical bars are hard to keep track of

For third graph:
-What are the different legends?
-Number survived is but proportion would also help
-What is the blue space? Did they just magically appear on the boat?



For fourth graph:
Number survived is OK but proportion would be more descriptive of which class was given preference during emergency exit.

For Fifth graph:
Again number survived is OK but proportion would be more
descriptive of which gender did better.

She also suggested I make the captions more information so it is
clear what I am trying to convey.
